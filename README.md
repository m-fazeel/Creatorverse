## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.
- Fetching data with axios was a bit challenging at first, however, after a while, I was able to implement it successfully.
- Styling and making the web app resposive was a bit tricky and time consuming, but I managed to do it.
